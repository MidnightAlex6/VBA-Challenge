# Background

In this assignment I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

•	The ticker symbol

•	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

•	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

•	The total stock volume of the stock.

•	Added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

• Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red

•	Made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

Below are screenshots of the completed files.:
