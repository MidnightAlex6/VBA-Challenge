# VBA-Challenge
use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
•	The ticker symbol
•	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The total stock volume of the stock.
•	Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
